  <h1>The Importance of ICT Integration in the Kenyan Education System</h1>

  <article>
    <p>ICT (Information and Communication Technology) is no longer just an option — it's a necessity in Kenya’s education system. As the world goes digital, our classrooms, teachers, and learners must evolve too.</p>

    <h2>1. Expanding Access to Quality Education</h2>
    <p>ICT allows learners in remote and rural areas to access quality learning materials through e-learning platforms, digital libraries, and virtual classrooms. No need for expensive physical textbooks when students can access open educational resources (OERs) with a smartphone or computer.</p>

    <h2>2. Improving Teaching and Learning</h2>
    <p>Teachers can use digital tools like projectors, simulations, videos, and smart boards to make lessons more interactive and engaging. This boosts understanding, retention, and interest — especially in subjects like science, maths, and computer studies.</p>

    <h2>3. Enhancing Digital Literacy</h2>
    <p>ICT integration builds 21st-century skills — from typing and research to coding and collaboration. In a digital economy, learners must be digitally literate to thrive in both the job market and daily life.</p>

    <h2>4. Supporting CBC and Competency-Based Learning</h2>
    <p>The CBC curriculum focuses on skills and competencies. ICT tools align perfectly with this approach by promoting problem-solving, creativity, collaboration, and innovation. Learners get hands-on experience, not just theory.</p>

    <h2>5. Teacher Empowerment and Professional Development</h2>
    <p>Through online training and digital platforms, teachers can upskill, access lesson plans, and collaborate with peers across the country. This leads to better delivery and improved outcomes for learners.</p>

    <h2>6. Reducing Inequality</h2>
    <p>ICT can help bridge the digital divide between rural and urban schools — especially when supported by government policies, public-private partnerships, and investments in infrastructure and electricity.</p>

    <h2>7. Real-Time Assessment and Feedback</h2>
    <p>Platforms like Google Classroom, Moodle, and even WhatsApp allow teachers to give instant feedback, automate tests, and track learner progress efficiently — saving time and enhancing personalization.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Kenya must fully embrace ICT in education to remain competitive, equitable, and future-ready. While challenges like cost, infrastructure, and training exist — the long-term benefits of ICT integration far outweigh them. It’s time we move from chalk to tech — and empower the next generation with the tools to lead.</p>
